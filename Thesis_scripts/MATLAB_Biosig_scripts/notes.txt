Splitting the file
------------------
- Run: split_w_overlap <inputfile>
- Requires: the input file name to not have spaces
- Also replaces the AMPSATs in the file with -1s

Convert annotations
-------------------
- Run: convert_annotations -t <num> <inputfile>
- <num> is the initial number appearing in the exported data
  One way to get that is to run: head -50 <inputfile>
  Scroll to find the first data line
- Output is produced in a separate file with the
  same name followed by _new and then the extension
- Might need the inputfile in unix format

Matlab
------
1. Import the EEG file
   data = importEEG('<filename>');
  
   - Imports the data in a matrix
   - Each line is a time moment
   - Each column is the value recorded by the EEG electrode,
     except for col. 1 which is the sequence number of the
	 particular time moment

2. Correlate the data to construct the graph, in windows
   A = window_correlate(data,0.7);
   
   - Note the hard-wired threshold for making the graph 
     unweighted. This is arbitrary, better to be fixed 
	 with the functions provided by BCT
   - A is a three dimensional matrix; the third dimension
     corresponds to the different windows in time. With
	 the third index c constant, the A[i,j,c] is the 
	 correlation between channels i and j at time c
	 
3. Plot some property of the graph(s) constructed above
   plot_nodes_property('clustering_coef_bu',A);
   
   - This uses the BCT toolbox. The function passed as 
     the first argument may be almost any from BCT
