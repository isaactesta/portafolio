# Portafolio with some of the projects I have done in the past few years.

The computational biology folder contains codes/algorithms that I wrote for various of my courses related to computational biology.

The computer vision folder contains projects that I did related to the field of computer vision, the projects were written in Jupyter Notebooks. The images in the folder are the ones used in the notebooks.

The Thesis scripts are the most recent I've written. They are some of the scripts that I am using while working on my master's thesis

Let me know if you have any questions.
