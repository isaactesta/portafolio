# Portafolio with some of the projects I have done in the past few years.

The computational biology folder contains codes/algorithms that I wrote for various of my courses related to computational biology.

The computer vision folder contains projects that I did related to the field of comuter vision, the projects were written in Jupyter Notebooks. The images in the folder are the ones used in the notebooks.

The DEAP Project is a short project where I used EEG signals to try to find the localization of emotional response in patients.

Let me know if you have any questions.
